        "Our encoding is ASCII, and to determine whether characters are in the ASCII a-z or A-Z we used the ord() function in python and that converts a letter to the ASCII number for a, z, A, and Z. That way we can check if the letter is acceptable by converting it using ord() and make sure the number is equal to or between a to z or A to Z. We also assumed the use of a Linux system and the current working directory to be /users/bob\n",

        "Our way of representing a file path was to convert the file path string to an array using the split() function and splitting at the “/” symbol. /home/bob would become [””, “home”, “bob”]. We can use this to more easily determine if paths are equivalent because we can now compare arrays instead of strings. So the .. will tell us to pop off the end of the path because it means parent directory, and the Tilda represents home so we hard-coded that in there. We also reject symbols outside of [\".\", \"_\", \"-\", \"~\", “/”].\n",
